# REPORT

## Overview
- Fixed backend import structure and added missing `__init__` packages.
- Updated backend routes to use absolute imports and added graceful error handling for history data.
- Simplified settings loader to avoid missing `pydantic-settings` dependency.
- Added backend and frontend unit tests with pytest and Vitest setups.
- Implemented client-only separation in Next.js pages and components.
- Created verification script `scripts/verify_project.bat` for automated checks.

## Run Commands
- **Backend:** `python -m uvicorn apps.backend.main:app --reload --port 8000`
- **Frontend:**
  ```
  cd apps/frontend
  npm run dev
  ```

## Test Summary
- Backend: `pytest -q` *(failed: missing dependencies such as pandas_ta/pkg_resources in this environment)*

## TODO
- Ensure required Python and npm packages are installed in the environment for tests to pass.
- Connect real market data provider and configure Redis if desired.
